# **Euclidean Distance**

Euclidean Distance is a metric used to measure the distance between two points.

## **What is Euclidean Distance?**

Euclidean Distance is the distance between two points in Euclidean space. The formula for calculating the Euclidean Distance between two points is:

d(x, y) = √(x1 - y1)² + (x2 - y2)² + ... + (xn - yn)²

where x1 is the first coordinate of point x; y1 is the first coordinate of point y; x2 is the second coordinate of point x; y2 is the second coordinate of point y; and so on.

The Euclidean Distance metric is used in many applications, such as clustering, classification, and regression analysis.

The Euclidean Distance formula is also known as the Pythagorean Theorem.

## **How is Euclidean Distance used?**

The Euclidean Distance is used to measure the distance between points in Euclidean space, and it is also used to calculate the similarity between two points. The similarity between two points is calculated as the Euclidean Distance between the two points divided by the maximum Euclidean Distance between all the points.

The Euclidean Distance is used in many applications, such as:

### **Clustering**

Euclidean Distance can be used to cluster data points based on their similarity. If the Euclidean Distance between two points is close to zero, then the two points are similar. If the Euclidean Distance between two points is far from zero, then the two points are dissimilar.

### **Classification**

Euclidean Distance is used to classify data points based on their similarity to a set of reference points. If a data point is similar to a reference point, then the data point is classified as the same class as the reference point. If a data point is dissimilar to a reference point, then the data point is classified as a different class.

### **Regression Analysis**

Euclidean Distance is used to predict the value of a continuous variable based on a set of input variables. The predicted value is calculated as the average of the values of the reference points that are closest to the input variables.

## **Conclusion**

Euclidean Distance is a metric used to measure the distance between two points. It is used in many applications, such as clustering, classification, and regression analysis.
